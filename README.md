# Docker Ghost

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/blockloop/ghost.svg?style=flat-square)](https://hub.docker.com/r/blockloop/ghost/)

[Ghost](https://ghost.org) as a docker container, deployed to Docker Hub.

I use this container on Dokku for my [personal blog](https://blockloop.io)
which means I update this frequently, but if you feel that I'm behind
[let me know](https://github.com/blockloop/docker-ghost/issues/new)
and I'll fix it asap.
